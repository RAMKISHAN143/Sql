## Synchronous Call or Single Thread:
 -- By default, 1 Action at a time, One by one Methods get executed. Dependency Exists, Lots of Time takes.

## Asynchronous Call (Async) or Multi Thread :
 -- Many Actions at a time, All Methods get executed Simultaneously or Parallelly. No Dependency. Fast.
 -- Thread is a Process. 1 Thread means 1 Method is getting Executed.
 -- Foreground threads are those threads that keep running even after the application quits.
 -- Background threads are those threads that will quits after the application exits quits.
 
 -- In Synchronous Programming, at a time Only 1 Method get executed, one by one Action. Slow.
    Page working and user interaction will stop until browser receives response from server. Bad.
    
 -- In Asynchronous Programming, at a time Many Methods get executed, Many Actions at a time. Fast.
    Page working and user interaction will Work Normally & It doesn't depend on Response from Server. Good.
   
 -- Asynchronous programming is very popular. It is done with the help of the async and await keywords.
    async keyword turns method into async method. which allows you to use the await keyword in its body.
    await means wait until the task is completed.

 -- We use async keyword with Method Declaration and await Task.Run( () => {our Logic} ); inside Method.
